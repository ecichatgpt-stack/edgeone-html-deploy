# SEO Competitive Analysis Report - Data Insufficient

I apologize, but I cannot generate a complete SEO competitive analysis report with the provided data. The dataset you've shared contains:

## Data Issues Identified:

1. **Empty Primary Record**: The first object in the array is completely empty `{}`
2. **Missing Company Information**: The second record shows "未获取到公司名称" (Company name not retrieved)
3. **Zero Traffic Data**: All traffic metrics are either 0 or "N/A"
4. **Insufficient Competitor Data**: Only 2 records provided (1 empty, 1 with no data), but the requirement is to analyze the target company + top 5 competitors (6 companies total)

## Required Data Structure:

To generate a professional SEO competitive analysis report, I need data in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "Brand": "Your Company Name (English)",
    "Brand_CN": "贵公司名称（中文）",
    "TotalDailyTraffic": 15000,
    "Baidu_PC_Traffic": 12000,
    "Bing_Traffic": 3000,
    "No_of_PC_Keywords": 8500,
    "Top_10_Keywords": 850,
    "Positions_11_20": 1200,
    "Positions_21_30": 2100,
    "Positions_31_40": 1800,
    "Positions_41_50": 2550
  },
  {
    "Brand": "Competitor 1",
    "Brand_CN": "竞争对手1",
    "TotalDailyTraffic": 25000,
    "Baidu_PC_Traffic": 20000,
    "Bing_Traffic": 5000,
    "No_of_PC_Keywords": 12000,
    "Top_10_Keywords": 1200,
    "Positions_11_20": 1800,
    "Positions_21_30": 2800,
    "Positions_31_40": 2400,
    "Positions_41_50": 3800
  }
  // ... (at least 5 more competitors with similar data)
]
```

## What I Need:

1. **Complete company names** (both English and Chinese versions)
2. **Actual traffic numbers** (not 0 or N/A)
3. **Keyword ranking data** across all position ranges (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc.)
4. **At least 6 companies total**: Your company + 5 competitors with traffic > 0

## Next Steps:

Please re-export the data from your webmaster tools ensuring:
- ✅ All company name fields are populated
- ✅ Traffic metrics show actual numbers
- ✅ Include data for at least 6-10 companies
- ✅ Verify the data export completed successfully

Once you provide complete data, I'll generate a comprehensive, professional SEO competitive analysis report with:
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Competition overview with competitive index
- SWOT analysis
- Deep metrics analysis with visual charts
- Opportunity identification
- Actionable recommendations
